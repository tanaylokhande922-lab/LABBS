/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles, allowing each user to manage their own data.
 * Learning paths and resources are publicly readable by all authenticated users.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the user.
 * - /paths/{pathId}: Stores information about learning paths, publicly readable.
 * - /paths/{pathId}/resources/{resourceId}: Stores learning resources under specific paths, publicly readable.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User listing is implicitly denied.
 * - Read-only collections (paths, resources) are handled by allowing public reads.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Ownership is determined by the path for user profiles (/users/{userId}).
 * - Paths and Resources are readable by any authenticated user so no denormalization is needed.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}.
 * - Public path and resource data is stored under /paths/{pathId} and /paths/{pathId}/resources/{resourceId}.
